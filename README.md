<h1>Create Config</h1>
<p>Creates a CircleCIÂ® config with as little as 3 lines of code.</p>
</div>

This is an example for you to write your own Create Config repo.

Feel free to use this.

Though you might like different settings, like different image sizes.

Or maybe you use languages.

This has JavaScript and PHP.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createConfig, JobNames } from "@getlocalci/create-config";

createConfig(JobNames.PhpLint, JobNames.PhpTest, JobNames.Zip);
```

## Adding A Custom Job

```typescript
import CircleCI from "@circleci/circleci-config-sdk";
import { createConfig, JobNames } from "@getlocalci/create-config";

createConfig(
  JobNames.JsLint,
  JobNames.JsTest,
  new CircleCI.Job(
    "python-test",
    new CircleCI.executors.DockerExecutor("cimg/python:3.10.7", "large"),
    [
      new CircleCI.commands.Checkout(),
      new CircleCI.commands.Run({ command: "pip install && python -m pytest" }),
    ]
  )
);
```

Here, you [add a](https://getlocalci.com/circleci-config-sdk-tutorial/#last-2-jobs) `CircleCI.Job` with your own values.

For example, maybe you have a typical config you use for most of your repos.

But a certain repo needs a specific job that no other repos need.

You can pass the `CircleCI.Job` as an argument to `createConfig()`.
